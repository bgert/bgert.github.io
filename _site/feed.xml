Its at a startup called rMark Bio. The company uses AI to try and bring together partners in the bio tech and pharma industries for collaboration. So far I have written an API unit test suite for one of their APIs using the &lt;a href=&quot;https://jestjs.io/&quot;&gt;Jest&lt;/a&gt; testing frame work. Through this I have become familiar with Node.js and increased my fluency with Git. I’m excited to see what else I can get done this summer!&lt;/p&gt;
