<p>I was able to get an internship this summer. Its at a startup called rMark Bio. The company uses AI to try and bring together partners in the bio tech and pharma industries for collaboration. So far I have written an API unit test suite for one of their APIs using the <a href="https://jestjs.io/">Jest</a> testing frame work. Through this I have become familiar with Node.js and increased my fluency with Git. Iâ€™m excited to see what else I can get done this summer!</p>
